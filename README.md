This is a map of NC HUD areas and their fair market housing rates from HUD data updated as of January 31st 2024. The dataset includes the fair market rent for 0, 1, 2, 3, 
and 4 bedroom rentals. The data is not county level but is within areas defined by the HUD. The map is shaded by the price for two bedroom rentals in each area but upon
clicking a polygon the data for each type should display in a popup. The base map is a leaflet basemap called CartoDB.Positron. The legend displays rents from 800 to 1680 or more. 
The colorscheme is YlGnBu. Dark blue values represent the highest rent prices. In the bottom left corner there is an image of the HUD logo. This map was made to compliment and add
to the article linked in the text box underneath the title. Upon hovering over a polygon the two bedroom rent and name of area for that polygon displays within the box in the top
right corner. Map created by Annika Sink as an Undergraduate at Appalachian State University.
